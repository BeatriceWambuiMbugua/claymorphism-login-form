# claymorphism-login-form

## Claymorphism as the new trend in the 3D world

#### box-shadow is the main guy for that magical shadow effect. So, we need aware of that.

## Specify a single box-shadow using:

**Two**, **three**, or **four values**. If only `two` values are given, they are interpreted as `offset-x` and `offset-y` values. 
If a **third** value is given, it is interpreted as a `blur-radius`. If a **fourth** value is given, it is interpreted as a `spread- radius`.
To specify multiple shadows, provide a comma-separated list of shadows.

* Optionally, the inset keyword.
* Optionally, a color value.
* **Note:** `Claymorphism is made up of inner shadow and outer shadow`

## for example for the above project:

`box-shadow: 5px 5px 7px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25),
inset 2px 2px 5px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25),
inset -3px -3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);`

#### you can fork the project for better practice or to observe from your repository.
